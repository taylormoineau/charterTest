Hello,

Please find attached the little project I threw together to represent the Rewards Program.

You can view this easily on Code Sandbox by following this link: 

https://46uzx.csb.app/1

It consists of three main pages:

1. Home ('/:currentMonth') - A splash page showing total points earned and a simple breakdown of this months spending/points.

2. Itemized List ('/itemized/:currentMonth') - A page with a table to display itemized purchases and how they earned you points each month.

3. Info for Items ('/item/:itemId') - A tiny page to emulate displaying a bit of data about individual purchases.

The actual data is found in transactionData.js

Calculating and filtering functions are found in getTransactionData.js.
getTransactionData() is the primary function from this page, which takes
the data and returns an object with the relevant filters applied.

A small loading div is located in LoadingPage.js

Navigation buttons and logic are found in NavigationButtons.js

Router.js wraps the entire app and holds its theming and a nav-bar. 
Since it is so small, it just made sense to do it this way.

Thank you!





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
